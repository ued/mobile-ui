This is because the leading symbol, \"2\", is larger than the other\n\t    // leading symbol, \"1\".\n\t    // The rule is that symbols to the left carry more weight than symbols to the right\n\t    // when a number is written out as a string. In the above strings, the leading digit\n\t    // represents how many 100's are in the number, and it carries more weight than the middle\n\t    // number which represents how many 10's are in the number.\n\t    // This system of number magnitude works well for route specificity, too. A route written as\n\t    // `a/b/c` will be more specific than `x/y/z` as long as `a` is more specific than\n\t    // `x`, irrespective of the other parts.\n\t    // Because of this similarity, we assign each type of segment a number value written as a\n\t    // string. We can find the specificity of compound routes by concatenating these strings\n\t    // together, from left to right.
